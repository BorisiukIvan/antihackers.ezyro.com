<h2>The most famous anti-hacker projects:</h2>
<p>Anti-hackers have many projects, the past - which have been and gone for a long time, the present - which are now, and the future - which will soon be. Here are the projects that are currently available and can be used.</p>
<h3>1. Bot playing chess</h3>
<p>The engine that plays chess on its own was written by me a long time ago - on <em>December 26, 2021</em>, when the war did not even think of starting. Not only does he play chess, but he plays it on the <a href='https://lichess.dev'>Lichess.dev</a> chess platform, so you can play him right now, here his <a href='https://lichess.dev/@/AntihackersBotik'>profile</a>.
<p>My bot, of course, is not very strong (about 1600 points in a blitz and 1900 in a bullet), but it must be taken into account that I am only 12 years old and I created it alone, even without pieces taken from the Internet. His tactics are simple: do not substitute pieces, have a piece if possible, do not substitute a checkmate, checkmate. One of his main shortcomings is that even if he has an extra rook or even a queen, then the opponent has quite good chances for a draw if he does not change pieces and blunder mate.</p>

<h3>2. Bot database</h3>
<p>Naturally, there are a dime a dozen bots like mine, <em>several thousand</em>. But lichess itself only shows the bots that are currently online on the <a href='https://lichess.org/player/bots'>this</a> page. And I decided to find bots, the rating of which will be approximately equal to the rating of my bot. No sooner said than done, and here I ended up with a list of thousands of bots, which I <a href='https://antihackers.neocities.org/'>posted to the Internet</a> (bots sorted by bullet rating).< /p>
<p>In order for your bot to get into this database, you just need to play at least one game with some bot that is in this database.</p>
